# Word Scramble Game

Welcome to the Word Scramble Game! This is a fun and interactive web application that challenges users to guess a scrambled word. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, shuffles its letters, and prompts the user to guess the original word.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game randomly selects a word from a list of fruits.
- **Letter Shuffling**: The selected word's letters are shuffled to create a challenge.
- **User Input**: Users can submit their guesses through a simple form.
- **Feedback**: The game provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is correct or incorrect.
- **Session Management**: The game keeps track of the current word using PHP sessions, allowing users to refresh and get a new word.
